# Python Matlotlib

### Overview

Evaluation of hypothetical ride share company Pyber, using Python, Pandas and Matplotlib to tell a story about the companies data

### Purpose/Objective

Demonstrate knowledge of Python, Pandas and Matplotlib, producing charts with labels and proper scaling.  Additionally, being able to bring in data, create usable tables and provide visual conclusion about the data.

### Conclusion

Rural rides typically have a larger average price per fare.  
    - I would follow this with a question.  Is there less demand in these areas or less available ride share          opportunities?
Having Historical data would allow for greater anaylsis and evalution.
    - This would help with making recommendations for all categories. 
    - Event if it was just current to last year data same at the same time.
For most urban cities, the number of rides is between 20 and 30 with a fares ranging from $20 to $30.
